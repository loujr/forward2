In python project you don't commit dependencies to the project
so typically this would be required: pip install -r requirements.txt

# TODOs
1. Why does installing packages fail????
2. Do we need a .python-version file or a pyproject.yaml?? 
3. Consistent build process
4. Readme for actions container or fwd?
